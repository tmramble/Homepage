# Welcome to Taylor's IT Professional Portfolio

Hello! I'm Taylor Ramble, an IT Architect Specialist at Atlanta Public Schools, where I focus on monitoring and cyber operations to protect our digital infrastructure. Currently, I'm advancing my expertise as a Cyber Operations student at the University of Maryland Global Campus. My experience spans incident response, MITRE ATT&CK, and Linux, all while prioritizing a low digital footprint.

In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my projects, relevant coursework, and other information that showcases my dedication to cybersecurity and continuous learning. I invite you to explore my work and see how I'm contributing to the ever-evolving field of IT.

Here are some of the key highlights from my portfolio:
